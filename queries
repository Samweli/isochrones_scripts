//Follow this queries to create a routable network from the roads.

1. Creating Road Extension

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW road_ext AS
   SELECT *, pgr_startpoint(geom), pgr_endpoint(geom)
   FROM dar;

2. Creating Nodes Table (This is for starting and ending points)

CREATE TABLE node AS
   SELECT row_number() OVER (ORDER BY foo.p)::integer AS id, 
          foo.p AS the_geom
   FROM (         
      SELECT DISTINCT road_ext.pgr_startpoint AS p FROM road_ext
      UNION
      SELECT DISTINCT road_ext.pgr_endpoint AS p FROM road_ext
   ) foo
   GROUP BY foo.p;

3.  Merging node and road view for a routable network

CREATE TABLE network AS
   SELECT a.*, b.id as start_id, c.id as end_id
   FROM road_ext AS a
      JOIN node AS b ON a.pgr_startpoint = b.the_geom
      JOIN node AS c ON a.pgr_endpoint = c.the_geom;
